      <h2 class="infoTitle">SUMMARY</h2>
      <p class="planeText">The main goal of my life is don’t stop learning and teach others what you’ve learned. Even if I reach success in something I ask myself questions like “What is my next step? What I should learn to make it better? How many useful experiences I achieved while I was working on it?” Now I found a huge field of interesting work and I’m going to explore it. I will make very beautiful websites, useful apps, share with other people what I had already known. But everything has its own time.</p>
      <h2 class="infoTitle">EXPERIENCE, EDUCATION</h2>
      <p class="plainText">For now, I have got some experience in various fields of programming world. I am familiar with HTML, CSS, Bash, Git, C, working in IDEs, SQL, etc. I have tried myself at learning algorithms, Docker, I learned Java as my first programming language. Telling in a nutshell after all that I have done I am leaning towards Front-End technologies and all that goes with it. After I graduated from a college I took courses on JavaRush. When I enrolled in the 21School I set the Java course on pause. During my studies there I learned lots of CS aspects, I learned С syntax and IDEs (VSCode, CLion). I worked with Docker, learned a few algorithms. Once upon a time I took part in Hackathon about CV, were I was to create database with car lisence plates and information about its owner. At the same time when I was home I spent my time exploring the basics of Front-End and Back-end development. And the first one inspired me. I have been learning English since I was 2 years old. My grandmother was my mentor. Also, I went on to an English course with a native speaker. As for me the main practice is to talk with English-speaking strangers using the Internet.</p>
