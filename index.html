      <h2 id="infoTitle">SUMMARY</h2>
      <p class="planeText">The main goal of my life is don’t stop learning and teach others what you’ve learned. Even if I reach success in something I ask myself questions like “What is my next step? What I should learn to make it better? How many useful experiences I achieved while I was working on it?” Now I found a huge field of interesting work and I’m going to explore it. I will make very beautiful websites, useful apps, share with other people what I had already known. But everything has its own time.</p>
