The main goal of my life is never stop learning. Even if I reach success in something I ask myself questions like "What is my next step? What I should learn to make it better? How many usefull experience I achived while I was working on it?" Now I found a huge field of interesting work and I'm going to explore it. I will make very beautiful websites, useful apps, share to other people what I had already learned. But everything has it's time.

For now I have got some experience in various fields of programming relatives. I am familiar with HTML, CSS, bash, Git, C, working in IDEs, SQL, etc. I have tried myself at learning algoritms, Docker, I learned Java as my first programming language. Telling in a nutshell after all that I have done I am leaning towards Front-End techologies and all that goes with it.

After I graduated from college I took courses on JavaRush. When I enrolled in the 21School I set the Java course on pause. During my time in there I learned lots of CS aspects, I learned ะก syntax and IDEs (VSCode, CLion). I worked with Docker, learned few algorithms. In the same time when I was home I spent my time to explore basics of Front-End and Back-end development. And the first one became the inspiring feel for me. I am always looking for something new to learn.
